      "description": "Rising nearly 5,000 feet above Yosemite Valley and 8,800 feet above sea level, Half Dome is a Yosemite icon and a great challenge to many hikers. Despite an 1865 report declaring that it was perfectly inaccessible, being probably the only one of the prominent points about the Yosemite which never has been, and never will be, trodden by human foot, George Anderson reached the summit in 1875, in the process laying the predecessor to today's cable route. Today, thousands of people reach the summit. For most, it is an exciting, arduous hike; for a few, it becomes more of an adventure than they wanted. Indeed, park rangers assist hundreds of people on the Half Dome trail every summer. Most of these emergencies could have been prevented... read on to learn how. Much of the hike to Half Dome is an adventure into Wilderness, and, while there is nothing you can do to guarantee your safety, below you will find some tips to reduce your risk and have a safer, more enjoyable hike.",
      "hazards": "The approach to Half Dome is steep and difficult. The last 400 vertical feet (130 meters) up the eastern slope are so sheer that Yosemite staff have installed cables for you to cling to as you pull yourself up. Without the cables or serious mountaineering gear, the ascent would be impossible. You'll find poles holding the cables up every ten feet or so along the slope, with a 2x4 attached to each set of poles at ground level so you can rest and contemplate your mortality before you attack the next section of cable. Get an early start, wear grippy shoes, and make sure you bring gloves if you are planning to summit Half Dome. Your hands will thank you!",

Deafening in spring and early summer when the waterfall peaks in volume, you can expect to get sprayed with water when standing on the footbridge near its base. This short, easy walk rewards with spectacular views of both Upper and Lower Yosemite Falls. This paved loop trail offers different vantage points of Yosemite Falls and Yosemite Creek, and you can stop at the many exhibits to learn more about the natural and cultural history of the area",
      "description": "The trail to Lower Yosemite Fall is open year-round. When the water is at its peak in spring and early summer, you can expect to get a little wet.

Hanging out at the base of the falls during peak runoff can be akin to taking a shower in a tornado, sans the flying cows.",

      "description": "This is a rugged overnight backpack into the North country of Yosemite dropping in from Tuolumne Meadows into the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne. Done at the beginning of Spring is best due to the high volume of water but be ready for some river fording through some very icy temperatures. It begins at an elevation just under 9,000' and drops to a low elevation of 4,500' almost 19 miles later at Pate Valley. Coming up out of Pate Valley heading towards Harden Lake is an elevation gain of almost 4,550' in just under 8 or so miles, be prepared for some thigh quivering demands. During the hike you'll pass a series of waterfalls starting with White Cascade Falls followed by Tuolumne Falls, California Falls, Le Conte Falls and finally the geological wonder, Waterwhell Falls, where the water flows down over a series of grooves in the rocks that can propel the water close to 20' into the air in a counter clock wise wheel, really spectacular.",

For this hike, though, you want to turn left half a mile along, where the trail intersects the old stagecoach road into Yosemite Valley. You'll reach Artist Point in just under half a mile. Shortly before Artist Point, you'll pass a viewpoint partially obstructed by trees; this isn't it - keep going and you'll find a much better view just around the corner. Just past Artist Point, the trail crosses Artist Creek. If you get this far, you've missed the literal point, though you'd have to be distracted by assorted bears and a flying saucer to overlook it. If you keep going, you'll eventually come out at Highway 41 a quarter mile uphill from Bridalveil Fall.",
