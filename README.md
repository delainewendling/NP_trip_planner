# Discover America
  As a student of Nashville Software School, I was given the task of creating a front-end capstone project. The requirements were: 
  * Create a basic CRUD app
  * Use Firebase to host data
  * Use Angular 1.x  

I decided to create Discover America. This application allows users to effectively plan a trip to Yosemite and/or Glacier National Park. Content for more parks is welcome! Features of the application include:
  * A map and list view of campgrounds and various trails in the park
  * Detailed information about each campground and trail
  * No limit on the number of trips a user can plan
  * A daily itinerary of each planned trip where users can add trails and notes. Users can also invite other users to collaborate on trips.
  

The project can be found here: [Discover America](https://delainewendling.github.io/NP_trip_planner/)
