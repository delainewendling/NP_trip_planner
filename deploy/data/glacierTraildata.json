Below the trail there is a vertical drop to Going-to-the-Sun Road, which progresses down the mountain from Logan Pass to Lake McDonald. The trail is wide enough for hikers to pass in both directions, and there is a chain to hold on to through a precarious stretch near the start of the hike. Highline Trail is not recommended for small children and those with a fear of heights. Keep and eye out for wildlife. The Garden Wall is a favorite environment for mountain goats and bighorn sheep.",

This is the first marked junction on the hike, a steep spur that tackles a thousand-foot climb in one mile to reach Glacier Overlook. The rocky track is unapologetically strenuous, but it rewards the effort with a view unlike anything on Highline Trail, an eastward vantage over Grinnell Glacier, which spills into Grinnell Lake and a string of turquoise lakes in the Many Glacier region of Glacier National Park.

Iceberg Lake Trail is a heavily traveled trail with a moderate ascent, Ptarmigan Tunnel Trail after the split from Iceberg Lake Trail, starts going up! Eventually you arrive at Ptarmigan Lake located at the base of Ptarmigan Wall. Before the trail reaches Ptarmigan Lake it comes to a series of small, scenic falls. If you are lucky the shoreline will be covered with wildflowers. The lake is a good place to rest as the next part of the trail is up a steep scree slope. Big Horn Sheep can often be seen on these slopes. the first time I hiked to Ptarmigan Tunnel there were Big Horn ewes on the slope, luckily I made it to the far side of the tunnel before a small group on horseback made it to the tunnel. This was actually the first time that I had encountered a private group on horseback in Glacier Park. In Yellowstone it is a fairly common occurrence. There can be snow cover in late July on this trail. From Ptarmigan Lake the trail starts up a series of switch backs on a scree slope. I was unable to see the tunnel from the lake, your eyes may be better then mine. The first time I did this trail I was very lucky to have several able body hikers, including my future son-in-law who had just climbed Denali. Once again I was carrying too much camera gear, so I grabbed onto my son-in-law's backpack when we got to the scree slope. When it got really bad one of my daughters would push while he pulled. It was worth the effort! From Ptarmigan Lake to the tunnel is a mass of broken rock that has over the centuries flaked off Ptarmigan Wall forming a talus slope. After passing through the tunnel you are on a trail which was carved out of the side of the mountain, providing your first view of the Belly River Valley and Elizabeth Lake. After walking down the trail from the tunnel a short distance you can see the Old Sun Glacier off to the northwest.",

      "whyVisit": "At 620 feet (189 meters), this cataract is short compared to Yosemite Falls, but chances are you still don't have anything like it in your neighborhood. It's famous for the mist that wafts off it when the breezes blow and which, according to the poetic, isolation-addled souls who get to name waterfalls, resembles a bridal veil. Hanging out at the base of the falls during peak runoff can be akin to taking a shower in a tornado, sans the flying cows.",
      "description": "Bridalveil Fall is often the first waterfall you'll see when entering Yosemite Valley. In spring, it thunders; during the rest of the year, look for its characteristic light, swaying flow. A paved trail leads from the parking area to the base of this waterfall, which flows year-round. Although paved, this is trail is not wheelchair accessible due to its grade.",
      "hazards": "The rocks and boulders above the viewing platform are slippery even when dry; stay safe by staying on the paved trail. Scrambling off trail in this area has led to serious injuries. If you choose to park along Southside Drive, when getting out of your vehicle, watch for traffic and be cautious opening car doors and crossing the road.",
